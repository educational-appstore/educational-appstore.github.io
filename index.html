            <p class="headline-description">
                A modern, student-created App Store designed to bring **fun**, **useful**,  
                and **safe** web-apps to your school iPad — without the limitations of Self-Service.
            </p>

            <div class="intro-message">
                <h2>Why Are We Building This?</h2>
                <p>
                    For years, students have relied on the district’s Self-Service app to
                    download school software. But let’s be honest — Self-Service is slow,
                    outdated, missing useful apps, and often fails to deliver the tools that
                    students actually need.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of these issues, a small team of student developers has dedicated itself  
                    to creating a new solution: a browser-based App Store that works smoothly,
                    installs instantly, and delivers apps the way you expect.

                    <p>
                        Unlike Self-Service, this store loads instantly, doesn’t freeze,
                        and doesn’t require any special profile installs or updates.

                        All apps included here are browser-based and follow school technology
                        rules. No system modifications, no downloads, no harmful content.

                        When installed, the store appears on your home screen with an icon,
                        opens in full-screen mode, and behaves like a native iPad application.

                        This store provides instant access to the apps students actually use:  
                        a chat platform, a call system, and a full game hub.
